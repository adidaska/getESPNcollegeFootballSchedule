# getESPNcollegeFootballSchedule
this is a python script that grabs the contents of espn college football schedule and dumps it into a csv to use other places. 
espn changes the site slightly each year so i have to make updates
i use this for a football pool site that needs the schedule in the database. hope it can help someone else too
